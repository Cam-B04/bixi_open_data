The data are available at [Bixi's website](https://bixi.com/fr/donnees-ouvertes).

## Bixi

Bixi is a non-lucrative sharing bike company created by the city of Montreal in 2014. It gives a glimpse of the data they collect such as the starting and ending point of every bike displacement, the geolocalisation of each parking station, etc.
